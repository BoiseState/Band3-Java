Not Easy - letter key shortcut in listview controls
X- limit decimal on stack parameters
X- movie a bit jerky
X- display location, material, E-field and potential 
  at bottom of chart when hovering.
X- add double click support to edit structure
X- Escape not working for voltage and temp in the main window,
  should return to previous value.
X- recreate output tool, duplicate movie fields.
